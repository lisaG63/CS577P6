Project Specification: Arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of an asset in different markets to make profit off of the differencein the asset’s price.  For example, with currency arbitrage, say 1 USD buys 0.83 Euro, 1 Euro buys 12.934 JapaneseYen, 1 Japanese Yen buys 0.096 USD. By converting currencies through theses exchanges (USD→Euro→Yen→USD), a trader on every 1 USD would earn1·0.83·12.934·0.096≈1.03or about a3%profit.You’re given a list of values of an asset across different exchanges and must calculate the minimum transactioncost (as an integer percent) so as to eliminate any possible arbitrage if starting and ending in the same exchange. Youmay assume the asset is infinitely divisible. In the above example, a transaction cost of1%would remove the arbitrageopportunity.Input should be read in from stdin.  The first line will contain the number of exchanges (n) and the number ofpossible trades (m) and all subsequent lines will contain 3 inputs, separated by spaces, where the first input is thebuying location, the second input is the selling location, and the last input is the integer price (p), in the sell market, of$100 of the asset in the buy market.
